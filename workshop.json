  "Description": "Ever dreamed you'd see the full devastation of your 6 armed [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2858367327]Insectoid[/url] Phase Cannonier omniphasing into your zero jell directly on the tooltip? Today is the day it comes true.\r\n\r\n[b]Improved Combat Tooltips[/b] brings you informative and snappy additions for even funner combat, such as:\r\n\r\n[h1]Combined Multiple damages [/h1]\r\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/IrAmD7W.gif[/img]\r\n\nIf one action does multiple instances of damage to a target, combine them into one tooltip, bigger in proportion to damage dealt to max HP. (That was a lot of hits huh).\r\nAs you can see in the gif above, even this snap(pped)jaw's instances of bleeding are combined into one tooltip (the small tooltips following the -15 one are me spamming the wait button to show bleeding damage. Only one appeared per turn). You can finally see how useful some abilities really are! \r\n\r\n[h1]Colored Special Damage [/h1]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/eEKEh6s.gif[/img]\r\n(Fire is more orange now, but I'm lazy to redo the gif)\n\r\nElemental and some special damage will show colored tooltips. Combined tooltips are included: if you did Physical + Cold + Electric damage this action, the combined tooltip will have the color of the most significant damage dealt, or always have the color of the highest non Physical damage if applicable (toggleable option).\r\n\r\n[h1]Visible Penetrations (toggleable)[/h1]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/8MaEMtb.gif[/img]\r\nA smaller tooltip will appear above you when you deal damage, showing the highest penetrations applied this action. Follows the colors of message log penetrations and toggleable to also display the penetrations of other characters above them.\r\n\r\n[h1]Show XP Points gained (toggleable)[/h1]\n[img]https://i.imgur.com/SE3TXjZ.gif[/img]\r\nXP Points gained will be displayed on the middle of your character - and of course, also combined when accidentally letting an Hand-E-Nuke slip in phase. Enjoy more direct gratification for your actions!\r\n\r\n[h1]And alsoâ€¦[/h1]\n[h2]* Smaller tooltips for continuous damage[/h2]\nContinuous damage like bleeding or poison will be shown in smaller tooltips to emphasize their indirect nature.\r\n[h2]* Show -0 when damage is applied but is 0 (toggleable)[/h2]\nSometimes you want to know something did something for nothing. Provided an option, off by default, to show a -0 tooltip when elemental damage has been resisted or bleeding ineffective for example.\r\n\r\nMod is compatible with existing games and free to enable/disable mid save. Only tested on version 205+ and beta but that should work on stable too. Let me know if anything up and have fun ;)\r\n",
